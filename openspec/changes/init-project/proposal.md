# Change Proposal: Initialize Project

## Why
The user wants to build a Todo App with Nuxt, Supabase, and Context7. We need to initialize the project structure and basic features to get started.

## Goal
Initialize the core structure of the Todo App, including Supabase connection, Authentication, and basic Todo CRUD operations.

## What Changes
- Configure Nuxt with Supabase and UI modules.
- Create database schema for `todos`.
- Implement Auth and Dashboard pages.


## Scope
- Configure Supabase in Nuxt.
- Create `todos` table schema.
- Implement Login/Signup page.
- Implement Dashboard with Todo List.
- Apply "Premium Design" aesthetics.

## Risks
- Supabase credentials must be provided by the user.
